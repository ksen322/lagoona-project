# lagoona-project
This project was made using <a href = 'https://www.figma.com/file/tjkkfkHDXlGscyVbS3emln/Lagoona?node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev'>Figma template</a>  
I used HTML for layout and CSS files  
No frameworks were used in this project, everything was built using flexboxes  
Also I made simply animation for links and buttons withous frameworks too
